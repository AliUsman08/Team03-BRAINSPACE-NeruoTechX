Team 3's documentation for the NeurotechX Global Hackathon!

Our model proves that EEG data can be used to predict mental states. This validates our research showing that by looking at theta and delta power we can examine a person's mental state and predict whether they have suicide risk or not.

The dataset used for this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions and the data is labelled under emotions.csv. The dataset is of EEG brainwave data that has been processed by features. The set of features extracted from the
EEG headband were five signals (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma). The data was collected from two people (1 male, 1 female) for 3 minutes per state - positive, neutral, negative. Six minutes of resting neutral data is also recorded, the stimuli used to evoke the emotions are below.
